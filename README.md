# Personalized Health Tracker

Very simple site I'm building to track my iron, vitamin d supplement intake/ hydration and overall protein habits.
Today: set up basic pages (home, habits, about) and nav links.
Backend + styles will come next days.

# Day 2: Backend start (Express + EJS)

- Created a minimal Express server in **backend/server.js**
- Set up **EJS** templates with a shared layout (**backend/views/layout.ejs**)
- Added a simple home view (**backend/views/home.ejs**)
- Served static CSS from **backend/public/style.css**
- Verified server runs locally at `http://localhost:3000`

Next: make a `/habits` page, then wire up a tiny SQLite DB for create/update/delete entries.
